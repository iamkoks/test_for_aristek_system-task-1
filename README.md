You need to create a function, which will group an array of objects by a key.
Requirements:
1. Ability to group by any key (in the example “universe” key is used).
2. Return an error if a key is not provided.
3. Return an error if an array is not provided.
4. Return an empty object if the provided key does not exist.
5. The function should be immutable (return a new array).
